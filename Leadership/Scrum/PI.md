### Talking Points

- Have you entered all PTO or Maintenance days?
- Has your velocity changed since last increment?
- Have any of your iterations overreached their capacity?
- Are you working on the highest priority Epics/Features from the Product Manager? If not, what is the reason?
- Waht are the risks/dependencies to the planned stories, and do you know when those dependencies are planned for completion?
- What teams are dependent on your stories, and do you know if they planned appropriately compared to when you'll complete your work?
- Have all user stories been linked to an epic?
- Have all user stories been assigned to a sprint (the comon sprints)?
- Are all user stories, spikes and bugs pointed?
